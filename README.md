# User Management Dashboard

## Description

This is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details. It uses a mock backend API (JSONPlaceholder) for demonstration purposes.

The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend and interacts with the **JSONPlaceholder API** to perform CRUD operations on user data.

## Features

- View a list of users with details such as **ID**, **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Department**.
- Add new users to the list.
- Edit the details of existing users.
- Delete users from the list.
- Interactive user interface with **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons.
- Responsive design to ensure the app works well on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS** for styling the page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript** for handling the frontend logic and API requests.
- **JSONPlaceholder** for simulating the backend API.
